Connect your chatbot to data sources via a webhook Now that you\u2019ve created your Watson Assistant-enabled chatbot, you need to connect it to a data source. With Watson Assistant, you need to do this via a webhook. A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response. Follow these instructions for setting up webhook with the Watson Assistant chatbot you just provisioned. Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack Now that you have a functioning Watson Assistant, let's deploy it to Slack. Slack is a cloud-based messaging application that helps people collaborate with one another. After you configure a dialog skill and add it to an assistant, you can integrate the assistant with Slack. When integrated, depending on the events that you configure the assistant to support, your assistant can respond to questions that are asked in direct messages or in channels where the assistant is directly mentioned. Read these instructions to learn how to integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack. Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Node-RED Want to create a voice-enabled chatbot?

Go back to your dialog skill and click on the Preview Link button on the side to get a link to test and verify your assistant. Step 13. Ask the Watson Assistant chatbot some questions about COVID-19. Integrate your chatbot with data sources Now that you\u2019ve created your Watson Assistant-enabled chatbot, you need to connect it to a data source. With Watson Assistant, you need to do this via a webhook. Our crisis communication chatbot uses two different sources: Watson Discovery COVID-19 API Defining webhooks A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response. Make use of Discovery to get news information Step 1. From your IBM Cloud account, go to Watson Discovery. Step 2. Create a new lite service. Step 3. Make note of the API key and the URL. You need that in the next steps. Step 4. Open the Watson Discovery NEWS service, which is a prepopulated discovery dataset updated and maintained by the Watson Discovery team. Step 5. From the top right corner, open the API tab. Make note of the Collection ID and Environment ID. Creating Cloud Functions In the IBM Cloud catalog, go to IBM Cloud Functions . Click Start Creating . Select Create Action . Name your action. For the Runtime dropdown, select Node.js 10 . Replace the code with action/covid-webhook.js Our code has two main parts. We decide whether to call the COVID-19 API or Watson Discovery based on a parameter sent on the function call. If a query param of type=api is set, you call the COVID-19 API on the summary endpoint . It returns the data in the following format: { Countries: [ { Country: \"\", Slug: \"\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, { Country: \" Azerbaijan\", Slug: \"-azerbaijan\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, ... ] } You then parse through the list of summaries for each country and sum up to get combined stats. If there is specific country selected, you look for that country in the summary response and return the , status for that country. For example, the response for type=api and country=US is shown below. { \"result\": \"Total Cases: 65778\\nTotal Deaths: 942\\nTotal Recovered: 361\\n\\nSource: Johns Hopkins CSSE\" } If you want to make a call to the Discovery service, you need to set some parameters that lets you call the IAM-enabled service. On the left, click on the Parameters tab. Add the following parameters: api_key , url , collection_id , and env_id . These are the values you noted from the Watson Discovery service in the previous steps. Enable the action as a web action. To do so, select the Endpoints tab on the left. Click the checkbox beside \"Enable as Web Action.\" Make note of the HTTP URL. You will use this as the webhook for your assistant. You will have to add .json in the end of this url to make it work as a webhook. Integrate data sources via a Watson Assistant webhook For detailed instructions on how to do this, check out our documentation: Making Programmatic Calls from Watson Assistant . Bring up the COVID-19 assistant you created earlier. Find it in your IBM Cloud account under services > IBM Watson Assistant. Open the dialog by clicking the CDC COVID FAQ Dialog. Click on Options on the left. Under Options > Webhooks, in the URL text box, paste the URL from the Cloud Funciton step. Make sure to add a .json at the end of the URL. Select Dialog on the left navigation. Open up any dialog node you want to add a webhook call for. After selecting the node, click Customize . Enable Webhooks by moving the toggle button to On in the Webhooks section. Click Save . Add any parameter your webhook needs. These will be sent as query parameters. Test that your webhook integration is working by going to the Try It tab and initiating a dialog that calls the webhook. You can easily use webhooks to give your Watson Assistant access to many external APIs and databases. Next steps Now that you know how to create a COVID-19 chatbot and connect it to Watson Discovery and the COVID-19 API, there are a few different integration paths you can take. The following tutorials show you how to integrate this chatbot with Slack, with a simple web application, or with a Node-RED dashboard. Embed your COVID-19 chatbot on a website Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Node-RED to enable voice commands Congratulations on building your first Chatbot with Watson Assistant!

When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response.","title":"Defining webhooks"},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/ASSISTANT/#make-use-of-discovery-to-get-news-information","text":"Step 1.

Click Start Creating . Select Create Action . Name your action. For the Runtime dropdown, select Node.js 10 . Replace the code with action/covid-webhook.js Our code has two main parts. We decide whether to call the COVID-19 API or Watson Discovery based on a parameter sent on the function call. If a query param of type=api is set, you call the COVID-19 API on the summary endpoint . It returns the data in the following format: { Countries: [ { Country: \"\", Slug: \"\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, { Country: \" Azerbaijan\", Slug: \"-azerbaijan\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, ... ] } You then parse through the list of summaries for each country and sum up to get combined stats. If there is specific country selected, you look for that country in the summary response and return the , status for that country. For example, the response for type=api and country=US is shown below. { \"result\": \"Total Cases: 65778\\nTotal Deaths: 942\\nTotal Recovered: 361\\n\\nSource: Johns Hopkins CSSE\" } If you want to make a call to the Discovery service, you need to set some parameters that lets you call the IAM-enabled service.

crisis, chatbots can help people quickly find answers they need to critical questions. In the case of a pandemic like COVID-19, people might be trying to find basic information about testing, symptoms, community response, and other resources. Video This tutorial shows you how to create a crisis communication chatbot using IBM\u00ae Watson\u2122 Assistant and how to add webhooks to Watson Assistant to query for dynamic data using Watson Discovery and COVID-19 APIs. Learning objectives In this tutorial, you will: Provision an instance of Watson Assistant Add a dialog skill to your Watson Assistant instance Connect your Watson Assistant with Watson Discovery Create Cloud Functions Integrate data sources via a Watson Assistant webhook Prerequisite Register for an IBM Cloud account, if you do not have an account yet. Otherwise, please proceed to IBM Cloud login Download the code from this GitHub repository Estimated time This tutorial takes about 40 minutes to complete. Create your chatbot by setting up a Watson Assistant instance We show you how to create a chatbot using Watson Assistant, a tool that enables you to build conversational interfaces into any application, device, or channel. Step 1. From the IBM Cloud catalog , provision an an instance of Watson Assistant . Step 2. Launch the Watson Assistant service. Step 3. Click Create assistant and follow these detailed instructions for how to create an assistant. Step 4. Name the Watson Assistant instance COVID Crisis Communication Step 5. Click Add Dialog skill to add this to your assistant. Follow the documentation if you have questions. Step 6. Click Import skill > Choose JSON file and import the skill-CDC-COVID-FAQ.json file. Step 7. Go back to the All Assistants page. From the action menu ( \u22ee ), open Settings . Step 8. On the Settings tab, click API Details on the left and make a note of the Assistant ID and Api Key for future use. Step 9. Go back to the All Assistants page and click on the Skills link. Step 10. On the Skill page, click on the action menu ( \u22ee ), open View API Details . Step 11. On the Skill Details page, make note of the Skill ID for future use. Step 12. Go back to your dialog skill and click on the Preview Link button on the side to get a link to test and verify your assistant. Step 13. Ask the Watson Assistant chatbot some questions about COVID-19. Integrate your chatbot with data sources Now that you\u2019ve created your Watson Assistant-enabled chatbot, you need to connect it to a data source. With Watson Assistant, you need to do this via a webhook. Our crisis communication chatbot uses two different sources: Watson Discovery COVID-19 API Defining webhooks A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response. Make use of Discovery to get news information Step 1. From your IBM Cloud account, go to Watson Discovery. Step 2. Create a new lite service. Step 3. Make note of the API key and the URL. You need that in the next steps. Step 4. Open the Watson Discovery NEWS service, which is a prepopulated discovery dataset updated and maintained by the Watson Discovery team. Step 5. From the top right corner, open the API tab. Make note of the Collection ID and Environment ID. Creating Cloud Functions In the IBM Cloud catalog, go to IBM Cloud Functions . Click Start Creating . Select Create Action . Name your action. For the Runtime dropdown, select Node.js 10 . Replace the code with action/covid-webhook.js Our code has two main parts. We decide whether to call the COVID-19 API or Watson Discovery based on a parameter sent on the function call. If a query param of type=api is set, you call the COVID-19 API on the summary endpoint . It returns the data in the following format: { Countries: [ { Country: \"\", Slug: \"\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, { Country: \" Azerbaijan\", Slug: \"-azerbaijan\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, ... ] } You then parse through the list of summaries for each country and sum up to get combined stats. If there is specific country selected, you look for that country in the summary response and return the , status for that country. For example, the response for type=api and country=US is shown below. { \"result\": \"Total Cases: 65778\\nTotal Deaths: 942\\nTotal Recovered: 361\\n\\nSource: Johns Hopkins CSSE\" } If you want to make a call to the Discovery service, you need to set some parameters that lets you call the IAM-enabled service. On the left, click on the Parameters tab. Add the following parameters: api_key , url , collection_id , and env_id . These are the values you noted from the Watson Discovery service in the previous steps. Enable the action as a web action. To do so, select the Endpoints tab on the left. Click the checkbox beside \"Enable as Web Action.\" Make note of the HTTP URL. You will use this as the webhook for your assistant. You will have to add .json in the end of this url to make it work as a webhook. Integrate data sources via a Watson Assistant webhook For detailed instructions on how to do this, check out our documentation: Making Programmatic Calls from Watson Assistant . Bring up the COVID-19 assistant you created earlier. Find it in your IBM Cloud account under services > IBM Watson Assistant. Open the dialog by clicking the CDC COVID FAQ Dialog. Click on Options on the left. Under Options > Webhooks, in the URL text box, paste the URL from the Cloud Funciton step. Make sure to add a .json at the end of the URL. Select Dialog on the left navigation. Open up any dialog node you want to add a webhook call for. After selecting the node, click Customize . Enable Webhooks by moving the toggle button to On in the Webhooks section. Click Save . Add any parameter your webhook needs. These will be sent as query parameters. Test that your webhook integration is working by going to the Try It tab and initiating a dialog that calls the webhook. You can easily use webhooks to give your Watson Assistant access to many external APIs and databases. Next steps Now that you know how to create a COVID-19 chatbot and connect it to Watson Discovery and the COVID-19 API, there are a few different integration paths you can take. The following tutorials show you how to integrate this chatbot with Slack, with a simple web application, or with a Node-RED dashboard. Embed your COVID-19 chatbot on a website Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Node-RED to enable voice commands Congratulations on building your first Chatbot with Watson Assistant!

Integrate your chatbot with data sources Now that you\u2019ve created your Watson Assistant-enabled chatbot, you need to connect it to a data source. With Watson Assistant, you need to do this via a webhook. Our crisis communication chatbot uses two different sources: Watson Discovery COVID-19 API Defining webhooks A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response. Make use of Discovery to get news information Step 1. From your IBM Cloud account, go to Watson Discovery. Step 2. Create a new lite service. Step 3. Make note of the API key and the URL. You need that in the next steps. Step 4. Open the Watson Discovery NEWS service, which is a prepopulated discovery dataset updated and maintained by the Watson Discovery team. Step 5. From the top right corner, open the API tab. Make note of the Collection ID and Environment ID. Creating Cloud Functions In the IBM Cloud catalog, go to IBM Cloud Functions . Click Start Creating . Select Create Action . Name your action. For the Runtime dropdown, select Node.js 10 . Replace the code with action/covid-webhook.js Our code has two main parts. We decide whether to call the COVID-19 API or Watson Discovery based on a parameter sent on the function call. If a query param of type=api is set, you call the COVID-19 API on the summary endpoint . It returns the data in the following format: { Countries: [ { Country: \"\", Slug: \"\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, { Country: \" Azerbaijan\", Slug: \"-azerbaijan\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, ... ] } You then parse through the list of summaries for each country and sum up to get combined stats. If there is specific country selected, you look for that country in the summary response and return the , status for that country. For example, the response for type=api and country=US is shown below. { \"result\": \"Total Cases: 65778\\nTotal Deaths: 942\\nTotal Recovered: 361\\n\\nSource: Johns Hopkins CSSE\" } If you want to make a call to the Discovery service, you need to set some parameters that lets you call the IAM-enabled service. On the left, click on the Parameters tab. Add the following parameters: api_key , url , collection_id , and env_id .

Steps Learn about Node-RED Node-RED is an open source programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click. Install Node-RED Dependencies nodes After Node-RED is installed, add the dependencies for this tutorial: node-red-node-ui-microphone node-red-dashboard node-red-node-watson node-red-contrib-play-audio Local installation instructions npm install node-red-node-ui-microphone node-red-dashboard node-red-node-watson node-red-contrib-play-audio IBM Cloud installation instructions Instead of adding the additional packages via Manage Palette , use the IBM Cloud Toolchain and the git repository in IBM Cloud to add the following packages to the package.json. Commit the change and the CI/CD toolchain will restage the CF application. \"node-red-node-ui-microphone\":\"0.x\", \"node-red-dashboard\":\"2.x\", \"node-red-contrib-play-audio\":\"2.x\", Explore node-red-node-watson Node-RED nodes The node-red-node-watson GitHub repository includes a collection of Node-RED nodes for IBM Watson services. This package adds the following nodes to your Node-RED palette: Assistant: Add conversational capabilities into applications Discovery: List environments created for Watson Discovery Language Identification: Detect the language used in text Language Translator: Translate text from one language to another Natural Language Classifier: Use machine learning algorithms to return the top matching predefined classes for short text inputs Natural Language Understanding: Analyze text to extract meta-data from content such as concepts, entities, and keywords Personality Insights: Use linguistic analytics to infer cognitive and social characteristics from text Speech To Text: Convert audio containing speech to text Text To Speech: Convert text to audio speech Tone Analyzer: Discover, understand, and revise the language tones in text Visual Recognition: Analyze visual appearance of images to understand their contents Import and deploy the COVID-19 crisis communication chatbot example Now that you have installed the Node-RED dependencies, Watson nodes are available to integrate Watson AI services. Let's build a voice enabled chatbot example that uses Watson Assistant, Watson Speech to Text and Watson Text to Speech. Import this flow and Deploy the flow. Create Watson Services on IBM Cloud Before the flow will execute successfully, you must configure the Watson Assistant and Watson Speech nodes with new service instances and API Keys. Create a Watson Assistant instance If you haven't already, create a Watson Assistant service instance . Follow these instructions to provision a Watson Assistant chatbot for COVID-19 Create a Watson Speech to Text service instance Create a Watson Speech to Text Service instance instance from the IBM Cloud Catalog. Click Create . The Node-RED Watson Speech to Text node will need the apikey credentials for this new instance. Once the Watson Speech to Text service is created, click Service credentials (1). Click the View credentials (2) twistie. Copy the apikey (3) for use in the next section Create a Watson Text to Speech service instance Create a Watson Text to Speech Service instance from the IBM Cloud Catalog. Click Create . The Node-RED Watson Text to Speech node will need the apikey credentials for this new instance After you create the Watson Text to Speech service, click Service credentials (1). Click the View credentials (2) twistie. Copy the apikey (3) for use in the next section. Enable Watson Speech Nodes with API keys Double click the speech to text node and paste the API key from the Watson Speech to Text service instance. Click Done . Double-click the text to speech node and paste the API key from the Watson Text to Speech service instance. Click Done . Enable Watson Assistant node with the COVID-19 Workspace ID and API key Double-click the assistant node and paste the Skill ID into the Workspace ID field, Assistant Service Endpoint URL, and the API key from the Watson Assistant service instance. Click Done . Parse intents and invoke API calls Watson Assistant returns the intents related to your questions. The Switch node routes two intents to an http request node to query an external data source for current COVID statistics. A Function node adds up the summary statistics and builds a sentence to be spoken. Deploy the Node-RED flows Click on the Red Deploy button. Talk to your COVID-19 crisis chatbot To talk to your chatbot, click on the microphone input button and ask a question about COVID-19. When someone asks a question, here's the Node-RED flow that happens in the background: Build a Node-RED COVID statistics dashboard Bonus : This flow includes a Node-RED dashboard with several gauges to display COVID-19 statistics. Every hour, the Node-RED flow will call the covid19api summary API and collect dynamic COVID-19 infection statistics. The country data is aggregated and then the gauges are updated. Learn more about the dashboard code The following Node-RED flow is included in this tutorial: The http request node uses the public Covid-19 API to retrieve the daily information for all countries with infections. Here's the sample JSON object from the summary API: {\"Country\":\"US\",\"Slug\":\"us\",\"NewConfirmed\":18058,\"TotalConfirmed\":83836,\"NewDeaths\":267,\"TotalDeaths\":1209,\"NewRecovered\":320,\"TotalRecovered\":681}, Each function node then aggregates the Total Confirmed Cases, Total Fatalities, Total Recovered, and Total Countries and sends the results to the corresponding gauge node. This is the code in the function node: let totalConfirmedCase = 0; msg.payload.Countries.map(function(line){ totalConfirmedCase += line.TotalConfirmed; }); msg.payload = totalConfirmedCase; return msg; You can expand the above dashboard to include daily new infections from covid19api data, charts, tables, and the chatbot UI. Build a Call for Code Crisis Communications solution! Now that you have completed this tutorial, you are ready to modify these example flows and Node-RED Dashboard to build a Call for Code COVID Crisis Communications solution.","title":"Index"},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/starter-kit/node-red/#_1","text":"Learn how to create a voice-enabled chatbot using Node-RED and the IBM Watson Assistant, Watson Speech to Text, and Watson Text to Speech services.","title":""},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/starter-kit/node-red/#authors","text":"John Walicki - IBM Isaias Rafael Angeles - IBM","title":"Authors"},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/starter-kit/node-red/#learning-objectives","text":"In this tutorial, you will: Learn about Node-RED and see how to install it locally and on IBM Cloud Explore the node-red-node-watson Node-RED nodes Import and deploy the Watson Assistant chatbot example Build a Call for Code COVID Crisis Communications voice-enabled chatbot solution","title":"Learning objectives"},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/starter-kit/node-red/#prerequisites","text":"Install Node-RED locally or Create a Node-RED Starter application in IBM Cloud After Node-RED is installed, add the dependencies: npm install node-red-node-ui-microphone node-red-dashboard node-red-node-watson node-red-contrib-play-audio - Create a Watson Assistant COVID-19 crisis communications chatbot .","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/starter-kit/node-red/#estimated-time","text":"Completing this tutorial should take about 30 minutes.","title":"Estimated time"},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/starter-kit/node-red/#architecture-diagram","text":"","title":"Architecture diagram"},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/starter-kit/node-red/#voice-enabled-covid-crisis-communications-chatbot-using-node-red","text":"The following diagram shows the workflow for a Node-RED chatbot that answers questions about COVID-19.

Our crisis communication chatbot uses two different sources: Watson Discovery COVID-19 API Weather Company Data Prerequisites Create an IBM Cloud Account . Create a Watson Assistant COVID-19 crisis communications chatbot. Follow these instructions Create a Weather Company API Account Make use of Discovery to get news information From your IBM Cloud account, go to Watson Discovery. Create a new lite service. Make note of the API key and the URL. You need that in the next steps. Open the Watson Discovery NEWS service, which is a prepopulated discovery dataset updated and maintained by the Watson Discovery team. From the top right corner, open the API tab. Make note of the Collection ID and Environment ID. Get a Weather Company API Key Go to https://callforcode.weather.com/register/ Signup with your info. Your API key will be emailed to you. Save the API key for future use. Creating Cloud Functions In the IBM Cloud catalog, go to IBM Cloud Functions . Click Start Creating . Select Create Action . Name your action. For the Runtime dropdown, select Node.js 10 . Replace the code with action/covid-webhook.js Our code has two main parts. We decide whether to call the COVID-19 API or Watson Discovery based on a parameter sent on the function call. If a query param of type=api is set, you call the COVID-19 API on the summary endpoint . It returns the data in the following format: { Countries: [ { Country: \"\", Slug: \"\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, { Country: \" Azerbaijan\", Slug: \"-azerbaijan\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, ... ] } If there is specific location (Country/Country Code/US State) selected, you look for that location either using The Weather Company API or in the summary response and return the status for that location. For example, the response for type=api and location=United States of America is shown below. { \"result\": \"Total Cases: 65778\\nTotal Deaths: 942\\nTotal Recovered: 361\\n\\nSource: Johns Hopkins CSSE\" } If you want to make a call to the Discovery service, you need to set some parameters that let you call the IAM-enabled service. On the left, click on the Parameters tab. Add the following parameters: api_key (Discovery API Key) twcApiKey (API key from The Weather Company) url (Discovery Service URL) collection_id env_id Enable the action as a web action. To do so, select the Endpoints tab on the left. Click the checkbox beside \"Enable as Web Action.\" Make note of the HTTP URL. You will use this as the webhook for your assistant. You will have to add .json in the end of this url to make it work as a webhook. Integrate data sources via a Watson Assistant webhook For detailed instructions on how to do this, check out our documentation: Making Programmatic Calls from Watson Assistant .

Click Start Creating . Select Create Action . Name your action. For the Runtime dropdown, select Node.js 10 . Replace the code with action/covid-webhook.js Our code has two main parts. We decide whether to call the COVID-19 API or Watson Discovery based on a parameter sent on the function call. If a query param of type=api is set, you call the COVID-19 API on the summary endpoint . It returns the data in the following format: { Countries: [ { Country: \"\", Slug: \"\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, { Country: \" Azerbaijan\", Slug: \"-azerbaijan\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, ... ] } If there is specific location (Country/Country Code/US State) selected, you look for that location either using The Weather Company API or in the summary response and return the status for that location. For example, the response for type=api and location=United States of America is shown below. { \"result\": \"Total Cases: 65778\\nTotal Deaths: 942\\nTotal Recovered: 361\\n\\nSource: Johns Hopkins CSSE\" } If you want to make a call to the Discovery service, you need to set some parameters that let you call the IAM-enabled service. On the left, click on the Parameters tab. Add the following parameters: api_key (Discovery API Key) twcApiKey (API key from The Weather Company) url (Discovery Service URL) collection_id env_id Enable the action as a web action. To do so, select the Endpoints tab on the left. Click the checkbox beside \"Enable as Web Action.\" Make note of the HTTP URL. You will use this as the webhook for your assistant. You will have to add .json in the end of this url to make it work as a webhook.","title":"Creating Cloud Functions"},{"location":"Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/starter-kit/webhook/#integrate-data-sources-via-a-watson-assistant-webhook","text":"For detailed instructions on how to do this, check out our documentation: Making Programmatic Calls from Watson Assistant .
