Connect your chatbot to data sources via a webhook Now that you\u2019ve created your Watson Assistant-enabled chatbot, you need to connect it to a data source. With Watson Assistant, you need to do this via a webhook. A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response. Follow these instructions for setting up webhook with the Watson Assistant chatbot you just provisioned. Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack Now that you have a functioning Watson Assistant, let's deploy it to Slack. Slack is a cloud-based messaging application that helps people collaborate with one another. After you configure a dialog skill and add it to an assistant, you can integrate the assistant with Slack. When integrated, depending on the events that you configure the assistant to support, your assistant can respond to questions that are asked in direct messages or in channels where the assistant is directly mentioned. Read these instructions to learn how to integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack. Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Node-RED Want to create a voice-enabled chatbot?

Some links may not be working, however, the original contents are kept for reference only. Defining webhooks A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response. You can query for dynamic data using webhooks in IBM Watson Assistant. Our crisis communication chatbot uses two different sources: COVID-19 API Prerequisites Create an IBM Cloud Account .

Select Create Action . Name your action. For the Runtime dropdown, select Node.js 16 or latest. Replace the code with action/covid-webhook.js Our code has two main parts. We decide whether to call the COVID-19 API or Watson Discovery based on a parameter sent on the function call. If a query param of type=api is set, you call the COVID-19 API on the summary endpoint . It returns the data in the following format: { Countries: [ { Country: \"\", Slug: \"\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, { Country: \" Azerbaijan\", Slug: \"-azerbaijan\", NewConfirmed: 0, TotalConfirmed: 0, NewDeaths: 0, TotalDeaths: 0, NewRecovered: 0, TotalRecovered: 0 }, ... ] } If there is specific location (Country/Country Code/US State) selected, you look for that location either using The Weather Company API or in the summary response and return the status for that location. For example, the response for type=api and location=United States of America is shown below. { \"result\": \"Total Cases: 65778\\nTotal Deaths: 942\\nTotal Recovered: 361\\n\\nSource: Johns Hopkins CSSE\" } Enable the action as a web action.
