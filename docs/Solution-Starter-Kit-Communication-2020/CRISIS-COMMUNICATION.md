## Overview

### What's the problem?
In times of crisis, communications systems are often overwhelmed with people trying to find basic information about testing, symptoms, community response, and other resources. When communication lines get clogged, people who need real help can't get through. Chatbots help respond to tens, even hundreds, of thousands of messages a day.

### How can technology help ?

Whether via text, phone, websites, or communication apps, conversing with chatbots and other AI-enabled resources can play a critical role in helping communities quickly understand crucial information and free up customer service resources to focus on higher-level issues.

IBM Watson Assistant service helps you build, train, and deploy conversational interactions into any application, device, or channel. Creating a chatbot using Watson Assistant can help address the issues that our users face while trying to gather accurate, relevant information. Whether you're trying to learn the latest news about Covid-19 or learn where there's testing in your area, a chatbot can play a major role in helping communities quickly understand crucial information and free up customer service resources to focus on higher-level issues.

## The idea

COVID-19 has citizens looking for answers about symptoms and testing sites as well as current status of schools, transportation, and other public services. Using Watson Assistant, this Call for Code Starter Kit has designed a virtual assistant pre-loaded to understand and respond to common questions about COVID-19, scan COVID-19 news articles using Watson Discovery and respond to COVID statistics inquires with data from trusted sources.

With this Watson Assistant powered Crisis Communications Starter Kit you can integrate a chatbot into your Call for Code solution in an IBM Cloud hosted web server, using a Slack integration or via a Node-RED Dashboard. 

It can:
- Respond by sharing consistent, accurate COVID-19 information
- Help citizens quickly and easily access the latest information through their channel of choice – voice, text or collaborative tool
- Free valuable resources by automating answers to common COVID-19 questions
- Dynamically update information with the latest developments and recommendations

The challenge for you is to build out from this framework to create a more complete solution.
